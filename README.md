# Team Generator
Team Generator is a Node.js application that allows a user to create an web page with team member profiles after answering a series of Inquirer prompts.

## Getting Started
To get the app running, install Inquirer after ensuring that your terminal is in the correct directory. To do so, type the following command into the terminal:

npm install inquirer

This will trigger a series of prompts that allows you to enter information for various members of a team. Team role options are:
- Manager
- Engineer
- Intern

After entering all information, a team.html file will be generated into the output folder. Open this file in the browser, and you'll see the team members you created in the terminal.
